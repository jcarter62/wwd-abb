Timers often play an important role in both client applications 
and server-based components (including Windows services). 
Writing effective timer-driven managed code requires a clear 
understanding of program flow and the subtleties of the .NET 
threading model. The .NET Framework Class Library provides three 
different timer classes: System.Windows.Forms.Timer, 
System.Timers.Timer, and System.Threading.Timer. Each of these 
classes has been designed and optimized for use in different 
situations. This article examines the three timer classes and 
helps you gain an understanding of how and when each class 
should be used.
